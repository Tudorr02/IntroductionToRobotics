  ## Each homework contains :
   - requirements
   - implementation details
   - code
   - picture of the setup
   - video

## Homework 1
  ### Requirements
  Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED : Red, Green and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.

  ### Implementation details
   - The first ( left side ) potentiometer controls the intensity of the Red color ðŸ”´
   - The second ( the middle one ) potentiometer controls the intensity of the Green color ðŸŸ¢
   - The third ( right side ) potentiometer controls the intensity of the Blue color ðŸ”µ
