## Homework 1
  ### Requirements
  Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED : Red, Green and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometer’s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.

  ### Implementation details
   - The first ( left side ) potentiometer controls the intensity of the Red color 🔴
   - The second ( the middle one ) potentiometer controls the intensity of the Green color 🟢
   - The third ( right side ) potentiometer controls the intensity of the Blue color 🔵
